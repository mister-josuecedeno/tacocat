## Objective

The Taco Cat coding challenge is based on the more traditional “Reverse a string” exercise but ultimately determines if a word or phrase is a palindrome.

The Reverse a string exercise in some form has been used by technology companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, VMware and Norton to assess a candidate’s ability to code an impromptu algorithm.

## Instructions

Write a program that allows a user to enter in a word or phrase and then prints out the reverse of what was entered.

Example: the user enters “developer” the output is “repoleved”.
